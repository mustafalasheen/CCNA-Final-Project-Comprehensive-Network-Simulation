# CCNA Final Project: Comprehensive Network Simulation

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive network simulation developed using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of my CCNA training. It simulates an enterprise-level network environment, showcasing practical configurations and real-world networking concepts.

## Features
- **Enterprise Network Topology:** Includes multiple routers, switches, and end devices.
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Implements VLANs to divide the network into logical segments, enhancing both performance and security.
- **Routing Protocols:** Configures dynamic routing protocols (OSPF/EIGRP) along with static routing to facilitate inter-subnet communication.
- **Network Services:** Integrates NAT for secure Internet access and DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation.
- **Security Measures:** Uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control and secure traffic flow.
- **Troubleshooting:** Demonstrates the use of various CLI commands (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`, `show`) for network verification and troubleshooting.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Network Design & Topology Planning**
- **Cisco IOS Command-Line Interface (CLI) Proficiency**
- **Dynamic & Static Routing**
- **VLAN Configuration & Inter-VLAN Routing**
- **Implementation of NAT, DHCP, and ACLs**
- **Practical Network Troubleshooting**

## Project Structure
- **ccna_final_project_1.pkt:** The primary Packet Tracer simulation file.
- **Screenshots & Diagrams:** Visual documentation of the network design and configuration steps.
- **Documentation:** Detailed notes on configuration commands, troubleshooting processes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer (version [specify version if applicable])
- Basic knowledge of Cisco networking, routing protocols, VLANs, NAT, DHCP, and ACLs.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. **Download and Install Cisco Packet Tracer:** If not already installed, download from the official Cisco website.
2. **Open the Project File:** Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and open `ccna_final_project_1.pkt`.
3. **Review the Configuration:** Explore the network topology, device configurations, and VLAN setups.
4. **Simulate Network Operations:** Use built-in simulation tools to test connectivity and troubleshoot any issues as described in the documentation.

## Conclusion
This project serves as both a learning tool and a demonstration of my networking capabilities. It reflects my commitment to mastering complex network configurations and preparing for the CCNA certification.
